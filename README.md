SOLID:

S: Single Responsibility
One class shouldn't do multiple things, It should have a single responsibility

O: Open close:
A class should be open to add features, close to modifications

L: Liskov principle
A child class should be able to all functions same as its parent class

I: Interface seggregation:
Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they cant do/do not use

D: Dependency inversion:
High level modules should not depend on the low level modules, both should be dependent on the abstraction modules
A robot can cut a pizza (using knife, chakum kartri should be flexible)
